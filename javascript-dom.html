        <h1>JavaScript Vs HTML & CSS</h1>
        <p>
          A website is composed by HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These three
          components together form what we call a functional web interface. A
          web interface is like music that requires not only words but also
          melody, harmony and obviously someone to perform it. So, in this case,
          HTML would be represented by the words in a song. The words are like a
          poem, they carry the content, the structure, however no or very little
          musicality. CSS, on the other hand, would be represented by the melody
          and harmony. CSS would bring the poem to a next level and make it
          sound beaultiful.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Besides having a fully written song with words, tempo, rhythm,
          harmony, melody, the music needs a musician or even a band to perform
          it otherwise it will only be a beaultiful thing but it won't be
          "alive". And the musician or the band in this case is represented by
          JavaScript.

        <h1>Control Flow & Loops</h1>
        <p>
          Your computer reads what you have written in a JavaScript document top
          to bottom normally, occasionally skipping some lines if you ask it to.
          And Loops are the part of the code where you want it to be read over
          an over again while a condition you define is not met, just like in a
          normal life situation. I am sure you can think of multiple things you
          have to do over and over again until you die. Let's say then you like
          to cook. Or if you don't like, let's say you have to cook everyday or
          even occasionally. What would be the steps for cooking? I will give
          you guys my example:
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>- Think what you want to eat.</p>
        <p>- Define the ingredients.</p>
        <p>- Check whether you have got them.</p>
        <p>- If you haven't got them you will have to go to the supermarket.</p>
        <p>- Cook the ingredients.</p>
        <p>- Eat.</p>
        <p>- If there is leftovers, store it into containers.</p>
        <p>- Do the dishes.</p>
        <br />

        <p>
          This would be a loop where you would perform your cooking during your
          lifetime.

        <h1>Document Object Model (DOM)</h1>
        <p>
          Like said before HTML is responsible for building the structure of the
          website. CSS on the other hand is responsible for making all that
          structure defined by HTML look sharp. And as a Higher Power brings it
          all to life, giving things interactiveness. But how does it actually
          work?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The interactiveness JaavScript creates comes from the DOM where in the
          web every element is actually an Object which means we can manipulate
          it. If we give these objects "names" through classes or ID's, we can
          actually select them using JavaScript change the way we please. We can
          change HTML content, CSS format and also bring some logics making the
          webpage run some calculations, displaying them on the page itself.
          This is the power of the DOM.

        <h1>Arrays Vs Objects</h1>
        <p>
          Both Arrays and Objects are widely used in most if not all the
          programming languages. They are both capable of storing data but of
          course in slightly different ways.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Having an array is like having a room full of space, and every time
          you want to store something is like putting an item inside a box and
          placing that in the room. The only condition is need to remember is
          the order because data from Arrays are retrieved back through its
          position that is exactly the position you put it in. That same content
          you stored in a box is not set in stone which means that you can
          replace what you have in that box something else, but the position
          stays the same.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, Objects work more like a hotel. You have the rooms which can
          be identified by names. These names we call "Keys" of an object and
          what you have inside of that room is what we call the "Value". So
          Objects work more like a pair value-key. It does not matter the order
          you store information in an object but you need to set it to an
          specific room, or "Key". And every time you want to retreive that
          information you need to access that specific key of that specific
          object.

        <h1>Functions</h1>
        <p>
          Functions are definitely one of the most important resources in a
          programming language. It feels like being a leader in a production
          team. But why is that?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Imagine you are having a new employee and obviously you have to get
          the person trained into your procedures. So you have to write it down,
          show the person how to perform it. And as soon as the person is fully
          trained you just need to ask him when you want certain activity
          performed. Ow well, with functions is the same. You write down the
          commands you want the function to perform. It is saved on your code,
          so whenever you need that same sequence of actions to be performed you
          just need to "call", "invoke" or "run" the function and it will
          perform the pre specified actions.
