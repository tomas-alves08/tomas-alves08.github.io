        <h2><strong>The problem..</strong></h2>
        <p>
          As part of the Kata Challenges during Sprint 4 I found myself on a
          situation where I should write a function that get items inside an
          array and convert into a string where all the items had the first
          letter capitalized.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img
            class="image"
            src="Capitalize String Error.png"
            alt="Capitalize String Error Image"
          />
        </div>
        <h2><strong>How the problem was solved..</strong></h2>
        <p>
          First I started going through the techniques I could possibly apply,
          so I opened the Developers tool on Chrome and started writing down my
          code, consoleloging on each main step to check for the response of my
          code until I got to the result I was waiting for.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img
            class="image"
            src="Solving-problem.png"
            alt="Solving Problem Image"
          />
        </div>
        <h2><strong>How I felt during this process..</strong></h2>
        <p>
          I honestly during not only this but throughout many other challenges I
          felt excited for solving the problems but also frustrated while
          getting stuck and not understanding exactly the reason.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>What I learned..</strong></h2>
        <p>
          However, the process is totally empowering. It makes me feel I am able
          to learn anything as long as I don't give up. So, on this exercise I
          learned and/or practice, specially, how to use DevTools, console.log,
          arrays, arrays methods and for of loops
        </p>

      <div class="values--content">
        <!-- <h1><u>Elegantly Solving a problem!</u></h1> -->
        <h2><strong>The problem was..</strong></h2>
        <p>
          The problem was the same as above however I was trying to make it more
          readable refactoring it, trying to find better ways to solve it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore I went to Google and I searched for javascript methods to
          capitalize words. Then I found a blog that gave the below example.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img
            class="image"
            src="Capitalize-word-Example.png"
            alt="Capitalize Word Example Image"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          And the second resolution for my problem ended up looking like below.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img
            class="image"
            src="Elegant-example.png"
            alt="Elegant Example Image"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          That's an awesome feeling to be able, first, to solve a problem,
          second, to be able to make it even better.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this time I learned the sky is the limit for programers. Tools
          like Google and StackOverFlow are amazing and make everyone's lives so
          much easier. We don't need to worry about getting things by heart
          because you can google anything at any time when you don't remember
          how to use something and there it is.

        <h2><strong>What is Pseudo Code?</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Pseudo Code is a "technique" used as a bridge in-between the algorithm
          and the coding itself. Algorithm is an organized logical sequence of
          the steps to be followed usually represented graphically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pseudo Code is performed by done all the steps the code will do but
          with human language which will later be translated into a programming
          language. It helps because it makes easier on the person to note down
          the steps they are intending to follow to code. It can also be
          implemented by simply breaking down the bigger tasks into smaller ones
          using comment lines.
        </p>
        <img class="image" src="Pseudo Code.png" alt="Pseudo Code Image" />
        <h3><strong>How confident I feel about it..</strong></h3>
        <p>
          I actually use this tool a lot. Back in the days I was working with
          Continues Improvement there was a planning tool that has the same idea
          as Pseudo Code that is pretty much to get a major task and break it
          down to a one-person-task-size. Breaking tasks down gives me a better
          way to track my daily goals. I know what I want to achieve for that
          day so it's easier to track my achievements and also where I am
          behind.

        <h2><strong>What is Code Readability?</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Can you picture yourself coming into a new project and having to
          review, adjust or implement new features into a webpabge. However, the
          situation you face seems more like a war field. You cannot understand
          what functions are doing what, you cannot understand the conditionals
          applied etc. etc...

          Where do you start from? It's a hard question. It's estimates that
          <strong><em>time spent reading vs time spent coding</em></strong> when
          someone new needs to review a website is
          <strong><em>well over 10 : 1</em></strong
          >. But, how can we improve that?
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some <u>best practices</u> when the topic is about
          <u>code readability</u>. The most common ones are:
        </p>
        <div class="list">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Reuse bits of codes when you possibly can, in other words, DRY -
              Dont Repeat Yourself!!
            </li>
            <li>
              Use identation to be able to easily identify the different blocks
              of codes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use self explanatory and meaninful names for variables and
              functions
            </li>
            <li>
              Use comments to explain beginnings of different parts and other
              parts of codes that are not obvious.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          You probably want to make the life of the next person who will have to
          work on your code easier. It actually can be you doing that, reading
          your own code. And no doubt you will work on someone else's code as
          well. We should all keep it tidy and clean.
        </p>
        <h3>How confident do I feel about it..</h3>
        <p>
          I am aware of the benefits of following the identation, DRY and other
          best practices regarding readability, however it's something that I
          have been practicing and getting used to. At the moment, as I am
          starting my journey I am more focus on getting things working but
          hopefully soon I will reach the level where I will be confident on
          programming and I will switch onto the making code simple, readable
          and efficient.

        <h2><strong>What is the Rubber Ducky Method</strong></h2>
        <p>
          The Rubber Ducky Method is a way of making someone's mind to look at
          the same problem but through a different point of view.
        </p>
        <p>
          This technique requires that a person having a problem explains what
          him/her is doing to sort the issue by reading the code and explaining
          what every single line of code means. The idea is that the person
          trying to explain what him/her is trying to do on each line eventually
          finds out what in the code is wrong.
        </p>
        <h3>How confident do I feel about it</h3>
        <p>
          I have just heard of this tichnique so I haven't explored it too much.
          But it's an easy and powerful technique in my opinion. The idea behind
          it is great.

        <h2><strong>Console Log:</strong></h2>
        <p>
          In my personal opinion, console logging is one of the most powerful
          tools a developer has. And it is because consologging allows the
          programer to have an instantaneous picture of how his code looks like.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a good habit to console log a piece of code while you are
          developing it so you can see if the result of your code is what you
          were expecting instead of finding that out a few steps down the track
          and having to get back and try to look for sometimes a tiny error.

        <h2><strong>Reading Error Messages:</strong></h2>
        <p>
          I am getting used to reading the errors. In the very beginning of my
          journey, I was really confused and didn't want to look at the error
          messages. They didn't use to make much sense for me. However, lately
          it's been way better. I sometimes can fix a problem straight away by
          what the message says. Sometimes it's problems that I have seen
          several times and then I can jump and fix it quickly. The error
          message tells you sometimes exactly where and what the issue is.

        <h2><strong>Googling:</strong></h2>
        <p>
          No one doubts Googles power nowadays on helping us to solve problems.
          It has got so much different resources that is hard to think of
          information you can't find in there. Google has got hundreds or
          probably even thousands of blogs that bring coding contents and
          therefore are there to help us when we lack on knowledge about
          programing tools. Google has also another increadible website that
          helps heaps, Stack Overflow. What else do I need to say? :)
        </p>
        <p>
          I use google pretty much every single day of my life. I have questions
          all the time and I just google then. They go from weather forecast,
          lyrics of songs, meaning of words in english all the way to complex
          formulas to perform engineering calculations.

          I have made a couple of friends at Dev Academy and I have been working
          with them a lot. It goes both ways. I ask for help and sometimes I try
          to help when any of us is struggling to pass through a challenge.
          However I try Google, Stack Overflow, Console Log, Error Messages and
          everything I can first before I go ask for help.
