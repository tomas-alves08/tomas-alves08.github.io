        <h1>Long Term Goal or Career Pathway:</h1>
        <p>
          I personally want to become a technically good front end web developer
          in the next couple of years. Hopefully find my first job by beginning
          of 2023 to get my foot on the door while I develop myself
          professionally, specially in regards to my developing skills.

        <h1>Learning Strengths and Limitations:</h1>
        <h2>Strengths:</h2>
        <p>
          I can really focus when I really want to achieve something. I also can
          easily problem solve, I guess. I am getting better at managing
          frustrations. I am also getting better on thinking as a programer.
        </p>
        <h2>Limitations:</h2>
        <p>
          I am a slow reader and I can only fully understand something when I
          can picture that in my mind however sometimes it takes a while.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought I was really good at reaching out for help however I
          realised I spend too much time trying to solve problems by myself. And
          I only ask for help when I have tried every single possible resources.
          However, now I see that I am trying to create a habit to expose more
          often when I am struggling and also even ask for a second opinion when
          my code is working because I see now that different people use
          different strategies to solve the same problem and looking at
          resolutions from different point of views will help me to become a
          better programer.

        <h1>Human Skills To Be Developed:</h1>
        <p>
          Emotional inteligence was always something I am obsessed about. I like
          to read about it because of course of its importance not only in a
          person's professional life but also in the personal one. I find self
          control when things get very frustrating my main downfall and this is
          always what I keep an eye on. To chill out when things go wrong.

      </div>
      <div class="values--content">
        <h1>Managing my Workload:</h1>
        <p>
          The plan is to focus as many hours as needed on my learning program.
          Balacing it out with easy physical activities, music and quality of
          both sleep and meals. This balance will help me to my sanity and
          consequently my productivity. When things start to build up I believe
          the best approach is to step back, breath, make a plan on what to do
          moving forward and stick to it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="values--content">
        <h1>Seeking for Help:</h1>
        <p>
          When I start to struggle with the deliveries and workload I will first
          seek for help with my workmates and later with instructors in a timely
          manner. In other words, I will keep track of where I should be and
          where I am at on every single sprint and if I notice I am starting to
          get behind, before it's too late I will seek for help.
        </p>

      <div class="values--content">
        <h1>Expectations on Facilitators:</h1>
        <p>
          As the name says, they help on the way, they try to make my path a
          little smoother. So what I expect is that facilitators as people
          looking from outside would be able to see things I can not see at the
          moment, so I would expect them to challenge me on certain ways that
          would guide my thinking. And based on that I would perhaps change my
          approach to certain problems.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="values--content">
        <h1>Possible Rescheduling Plans:</h1>
        <p>
          In an unlikely occasion of something really serious happening, I will
          think through what the possibilities are on catch ups and I will
          discuss that with instructors. However, this is definitely not
          expected.

      <div class="values--content">
        <h1>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
        <p>
          My personal goal has been getting better at managing my emotions for a little while and will still be during bootcamp. So, if I can get any better on it will be a great achievement for myself. I just want to be every day better than the day before, slowly but continuously imprioving. 
        </p>
        <p>Communication is also another skill that I always need to work on specially because english is not my first language, so expressing myself will always be a challenge.</p>
      </div>
      
        <div class="values--content">
          <h1>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h1>
          <p>As mentioned above, my expectations are that the bootcamp team will challenge me and guide me during this period. But I totally get the fact that my learning is my own responsibility. So, I understand I won't get answers from the facilitators but challenges. But I hope when I get stuck that they point out possible ways so I can go check myself and find my answers.</p></div>
          <div class="values--content">
            <h1>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h1>
            <p>I expect I will treat myself well where I will look after the quality of the meals and sleep I will have. I expect from myself to keep my learning as my first priority. I expect I make the best to become the best junior developer I can be. Those are my expectations during this and next stages.</p>
