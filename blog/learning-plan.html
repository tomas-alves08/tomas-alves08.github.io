        <h1>Long Term Goal or Career Pathway:</h1>
        <p>
          I personally want to become a technically good front end web developer
          in the next couple of years. Hopefully find my first job by beginning
          of 2023 to get my foot on the door while I develop myself
          professionally, specially in regards to my developing skills.

        <h1>Learning Strengths and Limitations:</h1>
        <h2>Strengths:</h2>
        <p>
          I can really focus when I really want to achieve something. I can also
          easily communicate with people if I am struggling on something and I
          also can easily problem solve, I guess.
        </p>
        <h2>Limitations:</h2>
        <p>
          I am a slow reader and I can only fully understand something when I
          can picture that in my mind however sometimes it takes a while.

        <h1>Human Skills To Be Developed:</h1>
        <p>
          Emotional inteligence was always something I am obsessed about. I like
          to read about it because of course of its importance not only in a
          person's professional life but also in the personal one. I find self
          control when things get very frustrating my main downfall and this is
          always what I keep an eye on. To chill out when things go wrong.

      <div class="values--content">
        <h1>Managing my Workload:</h1>
        <p>
          The plan is to focus as many hours as needed on my learning program.
          Balacing it out with easy physical activities, music and quality of
          both sleep and meals. This balance will help me to my sanity and
          consequently my productivity. When things start to build up I believe
          the best approach is to step back, breath, make a plan on what to do
          moving forward and stick to it.
        </p>

      <div class="values--content">
        <h1>Seeking for Help:</h1>
        <p>
          When I start to struggle with the deliveries and workload I will first
          seek for help with my workmates and later with instructors in a timely
          manner. In other words, I will keep track of where I should be and
          where I am at on every single sprint and if I notice I am starting to
          get behind, before it's too late I will seek for help.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="values--content">
        <h1>Expectations on Facilitators:</h1>
        <p>
          As the name says, they help on the way, they try to make my path a
          little smoother. So what I expect is that facilitators as people
          looking from outside would be able to see things I can not see at the
          moment, so I would expect them to challenge me on certain ways that
          would guide my thinking. And based on that I would perhaps change my
          approach to certain problems.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="values--content">
        <h1>Possible Rescheduling Plans:</h1>
        <p>
          In an unlikely occasion of something really serious happening, I will
          think through what the possibilities are on catch ups and I will
          discuss that with instructors. However, this is definitely not
          expected.
