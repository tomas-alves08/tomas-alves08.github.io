        <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence (EQ)?</h1>
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence starts with recognising your own emotions what
          is called self awareness. Understand how you react in each situation,
          what calms you down and what fires you up. Recognising what motivates
          you and what makes you loose focus. This is the first step. Second
          step is to learn how to manage it. You want to be in charge of your
          reactions and not the other way around. Therefore, you can practice
          how to balance emotions out. When you are angry how to cool you down,
          when you are aggressive how to calm you down. They "relation
          destructive" emotions are the ones we need to learn how to manage.
          Good emotions like being happy, motivated etc. don't impact negatively
          in a person's relationship with others therefore you don't usually
          need to worry about them. Next step, is to learn how to do the same
          with others, recognize and then influence their emotions. Learn how to
          help people to control their own emotions. It puts a huge extra layer
          of challenge on the EQ topic for any person. But once a person master
          these 4 steps no doubt this person will be able to effectively perform
          outstanding leadership positions. Not only in their work but also in
          their personal life.

          How is EQ different to the so called Technical Intelligence (IQ)?
        </h1>
        <p>
          IQ on the other hand is a different set of skills. It is usually
          related to technical skills. Abilities that someone acquire during
          their lives training how to perform specific activities. I guess we
          could include anything that is non emotional related.

        <h1>Why is it so important?</h1>
        <p>
          Technical skills are what make people perform their jobs however
          emotional skills will probably take them the an outstanding level. As
          per Daniel Goleman, one of the most well respected specialists on the
          topic, 80% of the competencies that differentiate top performers from
          others are related to the emotional skills.
