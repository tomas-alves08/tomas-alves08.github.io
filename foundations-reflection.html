          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h2>Manage Frustrations:</h2>
            <p>
              I noticed that sometimes the code won't work as I expect and it is
              fine. Every single programming language has got some peculiarities
              and it will sometimes have some behavior that I don't expect and
              it's alright because instead of causing me frustrations I should
              actually take it as a opportunity to learn one new thing. And the
              programer journey is all about learning so if I get frustrated
              with having to learn something new, I am probably at the wrong
              place. So, I will try to take not working code as a learning
              opportunity instead of getting frustrated.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Reflecting is the way to learn:</h2>
            <p>
              It was a big surprise for me that learning is more about
              reflecting about what you learned, which is pretty much thinking
              about what went well and what did not go that well. Reflecting
              helps your brain to keep the information.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Teaching helps you to learn:</h2>
            <p>
              Apparently, explaining someone else what you know helps you to
              find out what are the gaps on your own knowledge. If you cannot
              make someone understand something probably you do not fully
              understand about that specific topic. So sharing your knowledge
              helps you to learn more, so the idea that everybody is a teacher
              and a student at the same time guides this philosophy.

          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h2>Values:</h2>
            <p>
              You values in both learning and programming as actually in
              anything in a person's life guides how the person will behave in
              each circumstances. For instance, if a person has the value of a
              growth mindset person this person will often be more optimist
              about challenges him or her finds on the way. A person with a very
              strong ethical value will behave in a certain way. And any
              institution or organisation, whether it is work related or not,
              usually determines the values they are looking for and obviously
              they want to gather people who follow those values. And that's the
              importance of a person defining what their values are because then
              this person can more easily find the places which will be a better
              match for him/her.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Empathy:</h2>
            <p>
              Empathy is a very beautiful value because it brings the humanity
              into the game. The power of being able to put yourself on someone
              else's shoes is a great advantage when working in a team. People
              will feel more embraced when in an empathic environment and more
              likely to feel motivated, consequently enhancing personal
              performance. And it's not only about personal performance but also
              the idea of working as a team. If a person feels they are well
              understood by their peers and bosses it's more likely the
              interaction and deliverables of this group of people achieve
              higher quality standards, decreasing as a consequence
              communication problems.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Self-Awareness:</h2>
            <p>
              Self-awareness plays an important role on a person's life because
              it's everyone's responsibility to understand how they feel on each
              situation and as a consequence how they react because if you are
              aware of what triggers each emotion you are more likely to be able
              to manage them.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of the day, every person is responsible for how they
              react and how they interact with other people and it will define
              their values, obviously and therefore what group of people this
              person will be more suitable to work with.

        <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
        <p>
          The idea of neuroplasticity was something interesting that I actually
          have already applied but I hadn't explored much. There are a few
          skills I have developed by working really hard, but I strongly believe
          these are not a talents I have but passions which drove me to practice
          them day after day, almost an obsession, so I ended up learning. And
          it is all about neuroplasticity. The fact we are able to develop
          skills we did not have before. And it is so empowering because it
          gives people hope, the hope they need to fight for something they
          want. The hope will drive them to achieve what they strongly desire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also the fact that reflecting and teaching are great ways of learning
          were also a surprise for me. I had not thought about it before. The
          importance of sharing knowledge on a person's learning journey. And it
          is actually a beautiful advantage because it promotes people helping
          each other and it makes us more human, I believe. The sense of
          community.

        <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
        <p>
          No doubt the fact of writing down my reflections is one of the biggest
          challenges for me. I am definitely not a person who can easily
          translate my thoughts into words and write it down. Expressing my
          feelings in words is a big challenge but as discussed in the
          neuroplasticity it is something I can learn. If I keep practicing and
          include it in my habits one day it will feel way more natural than it
          does today.

          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h1>
        <p>
          I believe it is because Dev Academy understands the importance of
          human skills for a person's success in any department of their lives.
          Even if Dev Academy was not in the Tech Industry I still believe the
          institution would still have a strong focus on human development and
          it is because it is important no matter where you are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Human skills are not only needed in the Tech Industry, it is needed in
          any job or anywhere you have human interaction. Technical skills can
          make a of any professional a great professional, however only the
          human skills can bring the same person to an outstanding level.

          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h1>
        <p>
          Learning or polishing the human skills' knowledge is never a waste of
          time. It is great DEA has it on the curriculum because people that
          have not explored these topics before have now the opportunity to hear
          about them and go deeper if they want and also people who have
          explored them have the chance to refresh them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another advantage is that people on different levels can work together
          and share knowledge which makes experienced people get even greater on
          it and also not very experienced people started their learning journey
          on core values.
