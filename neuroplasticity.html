          People understanding they are able to master any skill fires them with
          hope and hope is the most power weapon an individual could have. They
          then know that they would be able to level up their skills in
          literally anything they would truly commit to.

          Believing you can learn anything gives you the feeling that nothing is
          impossible and the sky is the limit. Because I have seen so many
          people saying how lucky I am for having some of the talents I have but
          they don't how wrong they are because most of the talents I have were
          not given to me but acquired with a huge effort and more than that the
          perseverence that I, one day, would be able to achieve something I
          really wanted to achieve.

        <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <p>
          To be very honest, I often think if I was able to learn how to play
          music and also able to speak english coming from a non english
          speaking country, I am able to learn programming. Live a life speaking
          a different language other than your own is so overwhelming at times.
          It requires an increadible effort. So, if I face that day after day,
          it won't be any programming language that will stop me. So, the
          approach I use to increase neuroplasticity is trying day after day,
          and not giving up, believing one day all the things that I struggle
          today with will be simple and I will be laughing in the future on how
          difficult I used to find it. Positivity is the best way for a happy
          life.

          Reading the 7 habits of highly effective people by Sthephen Covey
          helped me on how to behave in order to be best version of myself I
          could ever become. Trying to incorporate those steps, specially the
          ones that were not natural for me helps me to define how I will face
          some challenges I have in real life. Sometimes it's just easier if you
          just become a reactive person other than a pro-active person. However,
          I try not to give up at times because I don't want to be average on
          anything I do. Please, find below the link of the video that gives an
          overview of what this book is.

        <p>
          Your mind defines who you are. So, no matter you don't have certain
          skill if you have the positive approach that you can learn and you can
          be great on it. Your mindset is more important than any skill. Beucase
          I person who has got a great skill but no positive mindset, has got
          only a great skill. However, someone who has got no skill but a great
          positive mindset can have any skill and can master it obviously with
          resilience and hard work.

        <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>

          I did know we all could learn things and I had heard before of the
          brain creating thicker pathways if you practice something over and
          over again. However I did not know the brain was phisically changing
          as well, growing in certain areas. But yes, it makes total sense. If
          the brain pathway for certain skill is becoming thicker is natural to
          think that more neurons are getting there. However, when I was at
          school I learned that neurons were cells that were not able to
          duplicate, so it was counter intuitive for me. Very interesting
          anyway.

          I will repeat to myself everyday that one day I will be able to become
          a great programmer and that's the reason that I am practicing it so
          much. It will keep my focus and will remind me why I am studying so
          hard on those days I want to give up.

          The video of Kobe Bryant saying how a winner must think was particular
          engaging for me. He makes it very clear it ain't easy and that it's
          actually a choice someone makes. But are you ready to pay for that?
          Are you ready to pay for success? Success will not be given to you,
          you got to go out there and bring it home. You got to own it, you got
          to deserve it. Please, find the video on the link below.

          I have no doubt that my understanding and believing on these concepts
          will make me thrive on coding. They will make me become the best
          version of myself on this game. While I choose to be the best I can
          possibly be, I will be very successful on this. And when I decide I
          don't want to achieve the best I possibily could I will probably step
          away from it at that moment.
