              “My development journey started at the end of 2021 when I was
              searching for a new hobby and I heard of programming. Programming
              was actually a passion since I was in Uni, so I thought it could
              be a good idea to give it a go again. I started with Python and
              then a little of arduino to bring a little of engineering into it
              as well. That's when I heard of web development. I researched a
              little about it, bought a online course and got really into it.
              And now, here I am, at Dev Academy trying to become a web
              developer.
