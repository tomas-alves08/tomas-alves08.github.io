          Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
          Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
          decision you made, and the consequences of your action.

        <p>
          When I was working as a production supervisor I used to have a very
          hard decision to make everyday. While my boss at the time used to ask
          me to push people to work everyday harder and harder, on the other
          side I could see some people were already making a great effort
          towards the team's goals to be achieved. However, I was often told how
          much better every single person in the team could do. So, I tried to
          balance out what I thought the team could actually improve and where
          we were already doing the best we could. The psychological pressure
          was quite high. I was not there just to work for the company. But in
          my point of view, as the supervisor, my job was to remove barriers so
          my team could do their best. I was never sure whether I was balancing
          things properly. However, when I resigned the job that's when I
          realized I was actually doing ok because the team made quite a warming
          farewell party. So I believe in their understanding I was also doing
          my best to be a good supervisor. In that occasion I just thought the
          most ethical thing to do was to make sure I was trying to achieve the
          company's goals but also looking after my team.

          Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.

        <p>
          Luckily, Brazil is a place where people are very friendly and social.
          So I bring that with me. I personally enjoy working as a team,
          respecting other people's opinions. Maybe because of my culture I like
          the enjoy the journey, meaning that I try to make of every week a good
          week. I try to catch up with friends, I try to play music to bring joy
          to my soul because we don't know how much time we have here on Earth,
          so I try to make sure if I go pass tomorrow that the time I had here
          was worth it. On the other hand, I had a very poor childhood and in a
          very corrupted country, so I had to learn the value of hardwork quite
          early in life. If I did not work hard my life would be extremely
          difficult. So I decided that studying would be my best option. So I
          studied really hard for years, so then I could go to a good university
          and consequently try the best jobs. All this journey made me how I am
          today.

          Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and

        <p>
          I am a focused person who strive to become the best version I could
          be. I learn fast, I focus on understanding the reason of why things
          work the way they work and because of that I can usually make things
          happen because I get how they work. However, there is so much we can
          do. Time is always a challenge. The amount of changes to the current
          technologies and how fast they happen is a struggle to everyone, I
          guess. And also, I can not skip the fact english is not my first
          language so it makes really hard on me to express 100% of what I
          think.

          Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work
          productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss
          the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and
          your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h1>
        <p>
          I was once working in a team where a person used to intentionally slow
          down the process and make conflict with others, dragging down people's
          moods and consequentely their performance. One of my strategies was to
          try to find what this person could do best being the further possible
          from other people. Many conversations with this specific person and
          others on how this person's atitudes were impacting people's
          performance were conducted. I think something I would try now would be
          finding something we had in common and try to bond with this person
          somehow and hopefully improve our relationship so that way trying to
          suggest changes would maybe be more effective.
